    <p>I'm a data analyst with over a decade of experience preparing, exploring, and interpreting data. Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with teams of analysts, account executives, and marketing / media strategists to bring data to life in meaningful ways. My work also often involves automating data processes to reduce errors and allow teams to focus on strategy rather than repetitive tasks. There’s something really satisfying about creating a workflow that saves time and makes everything run smoother.</p>

    <p>Beyond the spreadsheets and SQL queries, I’m also a musician and songwriter. Music gives me a creative outlet to explore melodic ideas. I find comfort in the structure of both music and data.</p>

    <p>This portfolio is a blend of my analytical work and creative mindset. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
